All data stored by DiscMon abides by the rules below.
To see exactly how data the data is used, you can view the bot's [source code](https://github.com/Jaxydog/discmon).
If you believe any data is used or stored improperly, please [file an issue](https://github.com/Jaxydog/discmon/issues).

**Data used for the purpose of bot functionality**
Publicly available data such as public user identifiers or values input into commands may be stored to ensure all bot features work as intended.
This type of data should be only stored as strictly necessary.

Any data within this category is either already able to be viewed by other users, input directly by the user through commands or modals, or generated by the bot from other stored data.

**Data used for the purpose of record-keeping**
This almost always comes in the form of logs of past actions, such as caught pokemon or battle results.
This type of data may be stored and deleted arbitrarily, as it isn't essential to bot functionality.

All data within this category is collected from user interactions, and can be deleted at any time using the purge command.

**Data used for the purpose of feature enhancement**
This is usually similar, if not the same, as record-keeping data.
As such, it can also be cleared with the purge command.

Data within this category is collected through a mixture of public information and collected data logs.

Stored data will __never__ be shared with any user; this project is made entirely for fun and I don't intend to profit off of it.
For any concerns, you can contact me directly <@206260650010345483>.
